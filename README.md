- Used NextJS 13 (create-next-app) for groundwork, uses current modern architecture such as Server Components and the
  App Directory structure for layouts.

- Styles with TailwindCSS utility classes as well as some custom styling. Integrates Tailwind+NextJS theming such as for
  dark mode.
- Utilizes ChakraUI for Component Library, also integrates custom theming for the components.
- ESLint config is written as my personal preference
- All typing is defined in comments.
